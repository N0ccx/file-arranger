# File Organizer Script

This Python script helps you organize files from specific directories (like Desktop, Downloads, Music, Pictures, and Videos) by sorting them based on file types and creation dates. It can also check for duplicate files and create a backup of the directory before making any changes.

## Features

- **Organize files by type** (e.g., images, music, documents).
- **Sort files by creation date** (e.g., sort into folders by month/year like `2024-10`).
- **Detect duplicate files** using file content (hashing).
- **Backup** your files before moving them.
- **Dry-run mode** to see what changes would be made without actually moving files.

## Requirements

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine.
